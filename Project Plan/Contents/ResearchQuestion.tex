Research Question goes here..

\begin{itemize}
\item Fill a gap
\item Don't offend anyone
\item Hypothesis - Can convex optimization perform better
\item The optmization time increases a lot when more parameters are introduced
\item The genetic algorithms aren't always going to find the optimal solution

\item Short term: En case study som kan visa på skillnaden mellan de två
\item Long term: A unified modelling software to optimize in early design phases

Finding optimal solution

, in terms of computational speed and memory used, than GA when applied to the early design process of a mechatronic system.
