The time-plan related to the project is included in appendix A. It specifies milestones as well as tasks that are to be completed during the project. The initial four weeks include activities regarding individual literature studies and the writing of a common project plan. These weeks are followed up by two weeks of learning the basics of CVX toolbox found in MATLAB, and the IDIOM software. This knowledge will then be used in the next phase where three weeks are devoted to implement convex optimization of a basic case/system with volume as the target value. If the modification/simplification of the problem is harder than solving the actual optimization, the following step will focus on modification/simplification of more complex models with the same objective function. If it is the other way around, then different objective targets will be optimized for the basic system. This phase is shown as two parallel tasks in the time plan. The final report will be written concurrently during the project.
