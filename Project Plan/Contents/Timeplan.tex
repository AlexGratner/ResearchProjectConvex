The time-plan related to the project is included in Appendix A. It specifies milestones as well as tasks that are to be completed during the project. The initial four weeks contain activities regarding individual literature studies and the writing of a common project plan. These weeks are followed up by two weeks of learning the basics of CVX toolbox found in MATLAB, and the IDIOM software. This knowledge will then be used in the next phase where three weeks are devoted to implement convex optimization of a basic case/system with volume as the target value. This phase is followed up by simultaneously working on a more advanced case as well as optimizing the basic case for another target value (e.g. cost). The research paper is going to be written concurrently during these activities. The three week phase when looking at a basic example may take more than tree weeks. Then the following phases will be shortened.
