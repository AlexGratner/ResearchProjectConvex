The method used in this project is based on inductive reasoning. Case studies are to be performed on basic as well as advanced systems to determine if convex optimization performs better, in terms of e.g. computation speed and memory usage, than genetic algorithms when applied to mechatronic system design. Empiric data collected are used in the inductive reasoning process to arrive at a conclusion.
