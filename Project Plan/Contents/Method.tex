The project is set up to prove a hypothesis that convex optimization performs better than genetic algorithms when applied to mechatronic system design. A case study of a mechatronic servo system will be completed where criterias such as computational speed and memory usage are analysed.  

The timeplan related to the project is included in Appendix A. It specifies milestones as well as tasks that are to be completed during the project. The initial four weeks contain acitivities regarding individual literature studies and the writing of a project plan. These weeks are followed up by two weeks of learning the basics of the Matlab toolbox CVX, and the IDIOM software. This knowledge will then be used in the next phase where three weeks are devoted to implement convex optimixation of a basic case/system with volume as the target value. This phase is followed up by simultaniously working on a more advanced case as well as optimizing the basic case for another target value (e.g. cost). The research paper is going to be written concurrently during these activities.
