This section presents the key words of the research and preliminary title.

\subsection{Key Words} 
There has been an agreement reached within the group that the title should indicate both the research context and mathematical tool. Therefore \textit{mechatronic system} and \textit{convex optimization} should be included in the title. Since the purpose of research is mainly focus on the modification of optimization algorithms, \textit{methodology} has not been included in the title.
 
\subsection{Title}
The preliminary title at this stage is \textit{Convex Optimization for Mechatronic System Design}.
