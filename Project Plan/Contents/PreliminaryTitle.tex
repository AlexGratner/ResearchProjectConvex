The preliminary title at this stage is \textit{Convex Optimization for Holistic Mechatronic System Design}.
The title should indicate both the research context and the mathematical tool used. Therefore \textit{mechatronic system} and \textit{convex optimization} should be included in the title. Since the research is mainly focused on the modification of optimization algorithms, \textit{methodology} has not been included in the title. The design methodology used emphasizes on a holistic approach, which is why \textit{holistic} shall be included.
