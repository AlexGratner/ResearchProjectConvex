abstract = {This paper presents a novel multimodal evolutionary$\backslash$noptimisation algorithm for the complex problem of$\backslash$nconcurrent and integrated design of a mechatronic$\backslash$nsystem, with the objective of realising the best$\backslash$ntopology and the best parameters from a multicriteria$\backslash$nviewpoint and with different preferences. The$\backslash$nassociated search space can be large and complex due to$\backslash$nthe existence of different classes of configurations,$\backslash$npossible topologies, and the parameter values of the$\backslash$nelements. The proposed algorithm efficiently explores$\backslash$nthe search space to find several elite configurations$\backslash$nfor different preferences, with more detailed$\backslash$ncompetition by incorporating the domain knowledge of$\backslash$nexperts and considering some criteria that are not$\backslash$nincluded in the course of regular evolutionary$\backslash$noptimisation. The developed approach consists of a$\backslash$ntwo-loop optimisation. For each topology, a genetic$\backslash$nalgorithm-based optimisation is performed to find an$\backslash$nelite representative of the topology. The elites will$\backslash$ncompete with each other to become the best design. A$\backslash$nstrategy of restricted competition selection is$\backslash$nemployed in the competition of topologies, with the aim$\backslash$nof finding alternative elites from which the one that$\backslash$nbest satisfies the customer preference may be chosen.$\backslash$nThe designer may incorporate a higher level competition$\backslash$nbetween elites in order to obtain the global optimum.},

abstract = {The use of approximation models in multiobjective optimization problems that involve expensive analysis and simulation processes such as multi-physics modeling and simulation, finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has become more popular and more attractive, especially for the optimization of complex mechatronics systems. Approximation models have been found as a promising tool for multiobjective optimization problems due to their capability for providing accurate modeling results with much less computations for intensive computation problems. Many present global optimization search techniques involve fitness evaluations that are expensive to perform, even worse for problems with multiple objective black-box functions evaluations. In this work, a new adaptive multiobjective optimization approach based metamodeling (AMOP) techniques is introduced. The approach can identify the Pareto front for multiobjective optimization problems efficiently with high accuracy. The computation cost associated with identifying the Pareto front for expensive black-box functions is reduced. The new search method was tested using benchmark test problems and mechatronics device design examples.},

abstract = {The conceivable development of information technology will enable mechatronic systems with inherent partial intelligence. We refer to this by using the term "self-optimization". Self-optimizing systems react autonomously and flexibly on changing environmental conditions. They learn and optimize their behavior during operation. The design of self-optimizing mechatronic systems is an interdisciplinary task: Experts in mechanical and electrical engineering develop hardware components while mathematicians and computer scientists bring intelligence to these components. Successful realization of the latter aspect is achieved by using a combination of modern modeling techniques and algorithmic methods. In this paper, we present a new approach which enables mechatronic systems to adapt their objectives to changing environment during operation. Furthermore, we explain the use of solution patterns in order to enable the reuse of proven solutions, which provide self-optimization in mechatronic systems.},

abstract = {In this work we present a genetic algorithm based method to design a mechatronic system. First, we present the sequential approach where we optimize the geometry of the mechanism, for a given path, and then solve the dynamic problem where we take into account the characteristics of the motor along with the inertia of the different links of the mechanism. Several types of objective functions are tested. We show, however, that this sequential method does not yield acceptable results for the dynamic behavior due to the fact that the geometry is assumed fixed when optimizing the dynamics. This led us to formulate a global optimization problem where all the parameters of the mechanism are considered simultaneously. The problem is then presented as a multi-objective optimization one where the geometry and the dynamics are considered simultaneously. The obtained solutions form what is called a "Pareto front" and they are analyzed for several different design conditions. This paper also shows the advantages of a multi-objective optimization approach over the single-objective one. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We are developing a dual panel breast-dedicated PET system using LSO scintillators coupled to position sensitive avalanche photodiodes (PSAPD). The charge output is amplified and read using NOVA RENA-3 ASICs. This paper shows that the coincidence timing resolution of the RENA-3 ASIC can be improved using certain list-mode calibrations. We treat the calibration problem as a convex optimization problem and use the RENA-3s analog-based timing system to correct the measured data for time dispersion effects from correlated noise, PSAPD signal delays and varying signal amplitudes. The direct solution to the optimization problem involves a matrix inversion that grows order (n3) with the number of parameters. An iterative method using single-coordinate descent to approximate the inversion grows order (n). The inversion does not need to run to convergence, since any gains at high iteration number will be low compared to noise amplification. The system calibration method is demonstrated with measured pulser data as well as with two LSO-PSAPD detectors in electronic coincidence. After applying the algorithm, the 511keV photopeak paired coincidence time resolution from the LSO-PSAPD detectors under study improved by 57\%, from the raw value of 16.30.07 ns FWHM to 6.920.02 ns FWHM (11.520.05 ns to 4.890.02 ns for unpaired photons).},

abstract = {This paper suggests a unified and automated design methodology for synthesizing designs for multi-domain systems, such as mechatronic systems. A multi-domain dynamic system includes a mixture of electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, and/or thermal components, making it difficult use a single design tool to design a system to meet specified performance goals. The multi-domain design approach is not only efficient for mixed-domain problems, but is also useful for addressing separate single-domain design problems with a single tool. Bond graphs (BGs) are domain independent, allow free composition, and are efficient for classification and analysis of models, allowing rapid determination of various types of acceptability or feasibility of candidate designs. This can sharply reduce the time needed for analysis of designs that are infeasible or otherwise unattractive. Genetic programming is well recognized as a powerful tool for open-ended search. The combination of these two powerful methods is therefore an appropriate target for a better system for synthesis of complex multi-domain systems. The approach described here will evolve new designs (represented as BGs) with ever-improving performance, in an iterative loop of synthesis, analysis, and feedback to the synthesis process. The suggested design methodology has been applied here to three design examples. The first is a domain-independent eigenvalue placement design problem that is tested for some sample target sets of eigenvalues. The second is in the electrical domain - design of analog filters to achieve specified performance over a given frequency range. The third is in the electromechanical domain - redesign of a printer drive system to obtain desirable steady-state position of a rotational load. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

With multidisciplinary optimization (MDO) methods, strongly coupled mechanical, control and other subsystems are integrated as a synergistic vehicle system. With genetic algorithms (GAs) at the system level, the mechanical, control and other relevant parameters can be optimized simultaneously. To demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed design methodology for mechatronic vehicles, it is used to resolve the conflicting requirements for ride comfort, suspension working spaces and unsprung mass dynamic loads in the optimization of half-vehicle models with active suspensions. Both deterministic and random road excitations, both rigid and flexible vehicle bodies and both perfect measurement of full state variables and estimated limited state variables are considered. Numerical results show that the optimized vehicle systems based on the methodology have better overall performance than those using the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller. It is shown that the methodology is suitable for complex design optimization problems where: (1) there is interaction between different disciplines or subsystems; (2) there are multiple design criteria; (3) there are multiple local optima; (4) there is no need for sensitivity analysis for the optimizer at the system level; and (5) there are multiple design variables. © 2005 Taylor \& Francis.},

abstract = {A multidisciplinary optimization method is applied to the design of mechatronic vehicles with active suspensions. The method is implemented in a GA-A'GEM-MATLAB simulation environment in such a way that the linear mechanical vehicle model is designed in a multibody dynamics software package, i.e. A'GEM, the controllers and estimators are constructed using linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) method, and Kalman filter algorithm in Matlab, then the combined mechanical and control model is optimized simultaneously using a genetic algorithm (GA). The design variables include passive parameters and control parameters. In the numerical optimizations, both random and deterministic road inputs and both perfect measurement of full state variables and estimated limited state variables are considered. Optimization results show that the active suspension systems based on the multidisciplinary optimization method have better overall performance than those derived using conventional design methods with the LQG algorithm. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Portilla-Flores2011,
abstract = {Parametric reconfiguration plays a key role in non-iterative concurrent design of mechatronic systems. This is because it allows the designer to select, among different competitive solutions, the most suitable without sacrificing sub-optimal characteristics. This paper presents a method based on an evolutionary algorithm to improve the parametric reconfiguration feature in the optimal design of a continuously variable transmission and a five-bar parallel robot. The approach considers a solution-diversity mechanism coupled with a memory of those sub-optimal solutions found during the process. Furthermore, a constraint-handling mechanism is added to bias the search to the feasible region of the search space. Differential Evolution is utilized as the search algorithm. The results obtained in a set of five experiments performed per each mechatronic system show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A simultaneous engineering framework for designing optimal
mechatronic systems is presented. In the first part of this paper, a
method, based on genetic algorithms, for optimizing the geometric
configuration of three-axis machine tools in the conceptual design stage

mode synthesis, to derive a low-order control model from a
finite-element description of the mechanical and drive structures of the
mechatronic system. In the third part, motion controllers are derived
that are robust against configuration changes of the mechatronic system
